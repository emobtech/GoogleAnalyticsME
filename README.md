# GoogleAnalyticsME

Google Analytics ME is a compelling and well defined API for Java ME developers who wish to integrate their apps into Google Analytics. With this API, developers will be able to prepare their apps to send out useful data, about how users are interacting with them. Those data will be valuable to identify, e.g., audience and improvement points.
